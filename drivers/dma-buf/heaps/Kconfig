config DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	tristate "DMA-BUF System Heap"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the system dmabuf heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA
	tristate "DMA-BUF CMA Heap"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable dma-buf CMA heap. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	tristate "QCOM DMA-BUF Heaps"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to build the dma-buf heap module. Other
	  heaps can subsequently be compiled into this module by enabling
	  the appropriate defconfig option.  If in doubt, say M here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF System Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	select PAGE_POOL
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF system
	  heap. This heap combines the built-in system heap
	  along with other optimizatons. If in doubt, say Y
	  here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM_UNCACHED
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF Uncached System Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to create an uncached QCOM DMA-BUF
	  system heap. This heap is equivalent to our system heap,
	  such that the memory is mapped as uncached. If in doubt,
	  say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF CMA Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF CMA heap.
	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_CARVEOUT
	bool "QCOM dma-buf Carveout Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && QCOM_SECURE_BUFFER
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF Carveout heap.
	  If in doubt, say Y here.
